* Added list operators for operate(). _CLIENT-646_  **Requires server >= 3.7.0**
* [isConnected()](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/tree/master/doc/aerospike_isconnected.md) now testing the clientâ€™s connections to the nodes. _CLIENT-624_
* Allow the Aerospike class to be extendable. _CLIENT-648_
* Added a [compression_threshold](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/aerospike_construct.md#parameters) client config parameter. _CLIENT-627_

## 3.4.5

### Fixes

## 3.4.4

### Features
* Added explicit control over the [batch protocol](http://www.aerospike.com/docs/guide/batch.html#server-configuration) through a `php.ini` config variable `aerospike.use_batch_direct`, or constructor config parameter `Aerospike::USE_BATCH_DIRECT`. The default value is 0 (i.e. _batch-index_) for servers with **version >=  3.6.0**. _CLIENT-567_
* Added support for Ubuntu 15. Thanks @lwille.


## 3.4.3

### Features
* Upgraded to C client [3.1.24](http://www.aerospike.com/download/client/c/notes.html#3.1.24).
* A new **backward incompatible** format for the data returned by [existsMany()](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/aerospike_existsmany.md), as mentioned in the [release notes for 3.4.0](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/releases/tag/3.4.0). The underlying C client interfaces with a new API for batch reads called [batch index](https://www.aerospike.com/docs/guide/batch.html), which is implemented in server versions **>= 3.6.0**. Since batch reads can now target multiple namespaces, the old format is no longer appropriate. Instead, an indexed array is returned in an order corresponding to the array of keys passed as the argument to existsMany(). _CLIENT-28_
* Allow TTL to be set with the write methods [increment()](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/aerospike_increment.md), [append()](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/aerospike_append.md), [prepend()](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/aerospike_prepend.md), [operate()](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/aerospike_operate.md), [removeBin()](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/aerospike_removebin.md) using  [OPT\_TTL](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/aerospike.md). _CLIENT-510_
* Updated the methods of class [LList](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/aerospike_llist.md). Added filters to find, findFirst, findLast, findRange.
* Expanded the examples for LList with [integer](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/examples/ldt/integer_elements.php), [string](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/examples/ldt/string_elements.php), and [map](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/examples/ldt/map_elements.php) elements.
* Removed deprecated LDT classes (LMap, LSet, LStack) and methods.
* Fixed the documentation for the Enterprise Edition [security methods](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/apiref_security.md).
* Fixed the installer to place the Lua system files in `/usr/local/aerospike/lua` by default. Path override can be done by setting the environment variables `LUA_SYSPATH`, `LUA_USRPATH` before invoking [`build.sh`](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/src/aerospike/build.sh).
* Travis-CI cleanup.

### Fixes
* Fixed bug where malformed keys triggered a segfault in getMany(). _CLIENT-140_ / _AER-4342_
* Fixed the client to cast PHP floats to and from as_double. _CLIENT-225_

* Fixed issue #57 - incorrectly identifying RHEL. Thanks, @npenteado :+1:

* A new **backward incompatible** format for the data returned by [getMany()](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/aerospike_getmany.md), as mentioned in the [release notes for 3.4.0](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/releases/tag/3.4.0). The underlying C client interfaces with a new API for batch reads called [batch index](https://www.aerospike.com/docs/guide/batch.html), which is implemented in server versions **>= 3.6.0**. Since batch reads can now target multiple namespaces, the old format is no longer appropriate. Instead, an indexed array is returned in an order corresponding to the array of keys passed as the argument to getMany().  _AER-4064_
* Tests and API documentation updated. Thanks to @rmondragon for his help.


## 3.4.1

### Features
* Added [Security Methods](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/apiref_security.md) for Aerospike [Enterprise Edition](http://www.aerospike.com/docs/amc/user_guide/enterprise/). _AER-3475_
* Added support for Debian 8.
* Clarified configuration steps for the activating the extension with web servers, such as Nginx and Apache. Thanks Mickael Hassine.

## 3.4.0

## Welcome to the 3.4 release branch

This is the first release along the 3.4 branch. The astute observation of @arussellsaw in issue #48 has initiated a bit of realignment with other language clients (for example, [aerospike/aerospike-client-python](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-python)) with regards to multiple results, such as produced by [aggregate()](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/aerospike_aggregate.md). In subsequent releases following **3.4.0**, the batch-read methods getMany() and existsMany() will change as well.

* In aggregate(), the result will no longer be wrapped in a pseudo-record format. Gone are the array keys _metadata_ and _key_, as they are meaningless. An aggregation returns transformed and reduced results which no longer are the same as the source data, the records matched by the secondary index query. Further, we are pulling the results up out of the _bin_ array key. If your Lua produces a single result map you will get back an array with that maps' fields as array keys. If your reducer returns multiple results, you will get an array of arrays, each of them key-value pairs. The example at [examples/query_examples/aggregate.php](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/examples/query_examples/aggregate.php) shows both types of aggregation. After installing the new version of the client run `cd examples/query_examples/ && php aggregate.php -a -c`.
* An upcoming change to getMany() and existsMany() (in a release > 3.4.0) will modify the returned result to an indexed array of records. In both cases, it will be equivalent to running get() or exists() in a loop and aggregating the returned records one-by-one into a PHP array. The batch-read methods will return a plural of the single equivalent methods. For example, getMany() on keys 1,2,3 in namespace _test_ and set _demo_ will return an array of what you expect from calling get() on each of those keys in a loop.

I hope you will see the benefit in these changes, and that if you use UDFs and batch-read methods the integration work on your end is minimal.

### Features
* Support for `null` as valid argument to a UDF. _AER-4003_
* Prefer to always download the appropriate C client ahead of building the extension. _AER-4001_

### Fixes
* Fixed issue #48 - a new **backward incompatible** format for data returned by aggregate(). _AER-3948_ Thanks @arussellsaw.


## 3.3.16

### Features

* Copy registered modules to user path in [register()](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-php/blob/master/doc/aerospike_register.md). _AER-3627_
